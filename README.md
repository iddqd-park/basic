## Features

- **Zero Installation**: Runs entirely in the browser.
- **Classic MSX Experience**: Replicates the blue screen, font, and feel of MSX BASIC.
- **Standard Commands**: Supports foundational commands like `PRINT`, `GOTO`, `LIST`, `RUN`, `INPUT`, `CLS`, and `NEW`.
- **On-screen Function Keys**: Clickable interface elements for quick command access (`color`, `auto`, `goto`, `list`, `run`).
- **Lightweight**: Built with no external dependencies, ensuring fast load times and clean code.

## Usage

1. **Start Coding**: Type BASIC commands directly into the virtual monitor.
2. **Execute**: Type `RUN` to execute your program.
3. **Manage**: Use `LIST` to view your current program or `NEW` to clear the memory.

### Example Code
```basic
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
```
